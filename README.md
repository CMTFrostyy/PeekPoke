# PeekPoke
A PS4 debugger for MacOS made with visual studio and xcode. Code is not organized and messy/not optimised because I didn't think this was going to become a fully working project. I was just messing around with visual studio for Mac and this project ended up being a full debugger for PS4. I hope you can learn with this for creating C# tools using windows libraries on mac. This project uses mono. Thanks to golden (https://twitter.com/goldfitzgerald and https://github.com/jogolden) for the ps4 library (JKPatch)
